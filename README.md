In-Game Changes
---------------

* Endermen do not pick up any blocks.
* All recipes are granted to the player.
* When someone is sleeping and others on the same server are not sleeping, the night passes significantly quicker.
* When anyone is sleeping, the weather will change to clear for a random time, roughly from 1 to 7 days of clear skies.
* Tool durability is shown in the action bar.
* Players AFK for 3+ minutes show up as gray in the list of players.
* Show player health in the list of players. This may not show up right away, but will kick in as soon as each player gets hurt or heals.

Optimizations:

* Most things are updated only once per second instead of happening with every tick.
* The code was rewritten to be as minimal as possible.

Recipes:

* You can smelt or use a blast furnace to get an iron ingot from a heavy weighted pressure plate, iron door, iron horse armor, and an iron trapdoor.
* You can smelt or use a blast furnace to get an iron nugget from a bucket, iron bars, shears, and a tripwire hook.
